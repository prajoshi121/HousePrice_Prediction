#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on features such as area and number of bedrooms. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, 
outlier removal, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning & handling missing values  
- Outlier removal using IQR and quantile method  
- Visualization (scatter plots, boxplots, histograms)  
- Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler  
- Linear Regression model training & evaluation  
- Cross-validation to check model stability  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Statsmodels  

##  Model Evaluation
- Training R² and Test R²  
- MSE & RMSE  
- 5-Fold Cross-Validated R²
